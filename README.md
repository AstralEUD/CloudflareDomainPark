# Cloudflare Domain Parking

Unlike buying or managing domains with registrars like Namecheap or GoDaddy, Cloudflare does not (yet?) provide a parking page for domains that are not currently being routed to a website host. Instead of a browser showing "This site can't be reached" becasue of a NXDOMAIN error, you can host this domain parking template with Cloudflare Pages for free, so anyone that happens to search your domain can see that you are planning to use the domain.
